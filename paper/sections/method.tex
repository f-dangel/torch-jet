We propose to exploit the linearity in the $K$th coefficients when propagating a family of $K$-jets through a computational graph to compute a differential operator like the Laplacian.
Such families of $K$-jets were already considered for the forward Laplace \cite{li2023forward} and randomized Taylor mode ~\cite{shi2024stochastic, hu2023hutchinson}.
Then, we show that differential operators with a suitable structure can be computed via the propagation of an appropriately chosen family of jets using an algorithm of Griewank et al.
\cite{griewank_evaluating_1999}.
The result will also include the ideas of \cite{shi2024stochastic} for computing arbitrary differential operators.
However, our proposed algorithm only needs jets of the highest derivative degree occurring in the differential operator.

\subsection{Exploiting Linearity to Collapse Taylor Mode AD}
To derive our proposed method, the considerations start with a sum over $K$th-order directional derivatives of a function $\vf$ like the Laplacian.
In our notation, this sum can be represented as
\begin{align}\label{eq:sum-k-directional}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \sum_{r=1}^R\left<
  \partial^{K} \vf(\vx_0),
  \otimes_{k=1}^K \vv_r
  \right>.
\end{align}
For the Laplacian, one has $K = 2$, $R$ equals the dimension of $\vx$, i.e., $R = D$, and the vectors are chosen as the unit vectors $\vv_r = \ve_r\in \R^D$.
Instead of nesting derivative calculations to compute the full $K$-th order derivative tensor to afterwards select only the required derivatives, $K$-jets can be utilized to (theoretically) efficiently calculate the required derivatives directly.
In case of \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, one propagates $R$ $K$-jets through the computational graph using Taylor mode as illustrated in the appendix \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-naive}. To obtain the differential operator \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, it is crucial to select appropriate input $K$-jets. To this end, we select the $r$th $K$-jet to $\vx_{0, r} = \vx_0$, $\vx_{1, r} = \vv_r$ and $\vx_{2, r} = \ldots = \vx_{K, r} = \vzero$.

Without further optimizations, then standard Taylor mode propagates $1 + KN$ vectors through every node of the computational graph, where the length of the vectors depend on the individual node.
Subsequently, one has to sum up the corresponding highest derivatives to obtain \cref{eq:sum-k-directional} as illustrated for our simple example in the appendix, see \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-naive}.
The approach we propose here is based on the observation that there is a special element in the set of integer partitions $\partitioning(K)$, namely the trivial partition $\tilde{\sigma}= \{K\}$ corresponding to the term $ \nu(\tilde{\sigma}) \left< \partial \vg(\vh_0), \vh_{K, n} \right>$ in \eqref{eq:faa-di-bruno} with $\nu(\tilde{\sigma}) = 1$, yielding
\begin{equation}\label{eq:faa-di-bruno-expanded}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \vf_{K, n}
  =
  \vg_{K,n}
  =
  \sum_{
    \sigma \in \partitioning(K) \setminus \{\tilde{\sigma}\}
  }
  \nu(\sigma) \left<
    \partial^{|\sigma|} \vg(\vh_0),
    \tensorprod{s \in \sigma} \vh_{K, n}
  \right>
  +
  \left<
    \partial \vg(\vh_0),
    \vh_{K, n}
  \right>
\end{equation}
for our simple example.
The last inner-product term on the right-hand side is linear in $\vh_{K,n}$, marking the key property for our method.
To compute the sum of $\{\vg_{K, n}\}_n$, i.e., \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, it is possible to directly propagate their sum, like $\sum_n \vh_{K,n}$, due to the linearity of $\left<\partial \vh, \bullet \right>$ and $\left< \partial \vg, \bullet \right>$ instead of passing the highest coefficients, like $\{\vh_{K,n}\}_n$, separately along the nodes of the computational graph.
This observation also holds for general functions $ \vf$.
Combining this insight with the Taylor mode yields our proposed {\em collapsed Taylor-mode AD}.
It propagates only $1 \!+\!
(K \!- \!1)N \!+\!
1$ vectors at every node in the computational graph, where the length of the vectors varies for each individual node in the same way as for the standard Taylor mode.
For our simple example, the collapsed Taylor-mode AD is detailed in the appendix, see \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-efficient}, where the changes are highlighted in \textcolor{\colorcTM}{\colorcTMname}.
To emphasize that the saving of $N-1$ coefficients at every node in the computational graph is indeed significant for common applications, important operators are discussed below.

\subsection{Second-order Operators}

\paragraph{Laplacian.} The Laplace operator (or simply \emph{Laplacian}) plays a central role in Physics and engineering, including electrostatics, fluid dynamics, heat conduction, and quantum mechanics \cite{foulkes2001quantum, pfau2020ab}.
It contains the Hessian trace of each element of a function, \ie, for $\vf: \sR^D \to \sR^C$, it is
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}\label{eq:laplacian}
    \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
    \underbrace{
    \Delta \vf(\vx_0)
    }_{\in \sR^C}
    :=
    \left<
    \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0), \mI_D
    \right>
    \quad
    \begin{cases}
      = \sum_{d=1}^D \left<
      \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0),
      \ve_d^{\otimes 2}
      \right>
      &\text{(exact)}
      \\
      \overset{\text{\cite{shi2024stochastic}}}{\approx}
      \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S
      \left<
      \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0),
      \vv_s^{\otimes 2}
      \right>
      &\text{(stochastic)}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  with the $d$-th standard basis vector $\ve_d$ used for exact computation, and $S$ random vectors $\vv_s$ drawn \iid from a distribution with unit variance (\eg Rademacher or standard Gaussian) for stochastic estimation.
  By pattern-matching \cref{eq:laplacian} with the RHS of \cref{eq:sum-k-directional} we conclude that $K=2$, and the following choices for computing the Laplacian with standard Taylor mode:
  \begin{align}
    \begin{array}{rlrlrlll}
      \{(\vx_{0,d} & = \vx_0, &\vx_{1, d} & = \ve_d, & \vx_{2,d} &= \vzero)\}_{d=1}^D
                                                                   \quad
      &{\color{tab-orange} 1 + D + D\, \text{vectors}}
        \quad
      &\text{(exact)}
      \\[1ex]
      \{(\vx_{0,s} & = \vx_0, &\vx_{1, s} & = \vv_s, &\vx_{2,s} & = \vzero)\}_{s=1}^S
                                                                  \quad
      &{\color{tab-orange} 1 + S + S\, \text{vectors}}
        \quad
      &\text{(stochastic)}
    \end{array}.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Collapsing standard Taylor mode yields {\color{tab-green}$1 + D + 1$} (exact) and {\color{tab-green}{$1 + S + 1$}} (stochastic) vectors.
In fact, the collapsed Taylor mode for the exact Laplacian is the forward Laplacian from \citet{li2023forward} (see \cref{eq:laplacian-efficient} for detailed presentation of the forward propagation).
Note how we seamlessly can also support more efficient stochastic approximation.

\paragraph{Weighted Laplacian.}
A natural generalization of the Laplacian involves contracting with a positive semi-definite matrix $\mD = \msigma \msigma^\top \in \mathbb R^{D\times D}$ rather than the identity.
Assume $\rank(\mD) = R$ and therefore $\msigma = (\vs_1, \dots, \vs_R) \in \sR^{D \times R} = \smash{\sum_{r=1}^R \vs_r \vs_r^\top}$.
For example, $\mD$ represents the diffusion tensor in Kolmogorov-type PDEs like the Fokker-Planck equation \cite{hu2023hutchinson}, and $\msigma$ can depend on $\vx_0$ \cite{fa2011solution}.
The weighted Laplacian contains the weighted Hessian's trace $\Tr(\msigma \msigma^{\top} \partial^2 [\vf]_c)$for each output element $c$ of a function.
In the general case,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}\label{eq:weighted-laplacian}
    \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
    \underbrace{
    \Delta_\mD \vf(\vx_0)
    }_{\in \sR^C}
    :=
    \left<
    \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0), \mD
    \right>
    \quad
    \begin{cases}
      = \sum_{r=1}^R
      \left< \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0), \vs_r^{\otimes 2} \right>
      & \text{(exact)}
      \\
      \overset{\text{\cite{hu2023hutchinson}}}{\approx}
      \frac{1}{S}
      \sum_{s=1}^S
      \left< \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0), (\msigma \vv_s)^{\otimes 2} \right>
      & \text{(stochastic)}
    \end{cases}
    .
  \end{align}
  Computing it requires computing the following 2-jets with standard Taylor mode:
  \begin{align}
    \begin{array}{rlrlrlll}
      \{(\vx_{0,r} & = \vx_0, &\vx_{1, r} & = \vs_r, & \vx_{2,r} &= \vzero)\}_{r=1}^R
                                                                   \quad
      &{\color{tab-orange} 1 + R + R\, \text{vectors}}
        \quad
      &\text{(exact)}
      \\[1ex]
      \{(\vx_{0,s} & = \vx_0, &\vx_{1, s} & = \msigma \vv_s, &\vx_{2,s} & = \vzero)\}_{s=1}^S
                                                                  \quad
      &{\color{tab-orange} 1 + S + S\, \text{vectors}}
        \quad
      &\text{(stochastic)}
    \end{array}.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Collapsing standard Taylor mode yields {\color{tab-green}$1 + R + 1$} (exact) and {\color{tab-green}{$1 + S + 1$}} (stochastic) vectors.
This yields the modified forward Laplacian from \citet{li2024dof}; collapsing the stochastic variant speeds up the Hutchinson trace estimator from \citet{hu2023hutchinson}.
For indefinite $\mD$, we can simply apply this scheme to the positive and negative eigen-spaces.
However, such weighted Laplacians are not used in practise.

\subsection{Collapsed Taylor Mode for Arbitrary Mixed Partial Derivatives}
So far, we discussed operators that result from contracting the second-order derivative tensor with a coefficient matrix ($\mI$ or $\mD$) that can conveniently be written as sum of vector outer products.
For orders higher than two, the coefficient tensor can in general \emph{not} be decomposed as such.
To tackle this problem, we extend our framework to transform a differential operator containing mixed-partial derivatives into a family of jets using the result of \citet{griewank_evaluating_1999}.
We will then demonstrate the approach on the biharmonic operator with 4-dimensional coefficient tensor
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:biharm}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \Delta^2 \vf(\vx_0)
  \coloneqq
  \Delta(\Delta \vf(\vx_0))
  \quad
  \begin{cases}
    =
    \sum_{d_1=1}^D \sum_{d_2=1}^D
    \left<
    \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0),
    \ve_{d_1}^{\otimes 2} \otimes \ve_{d_2}^{\otimes 2}
    \right>
    & \text{(exact)}
    \\
    \overset{\text{\cite{shi2024stochastic}}}{\approx}
    \frac{1}{S}
    \sum_{s=1}^S
    \left< \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0), \vv_s^{\otimes 4} \right>
    & \text{(stochastic)}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

\paragraph{General approach.}
Assume we want to contract the $K$-th order derivative tensor $\partial^K \vf(\vx_0)$ with a coefficient tensor $\tC \in (\sR^D)^{\otimes K}$.
We can always express this tensor in a tensor product basis,
\begin{align}\label{eq:sums-k-directional}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \left<
  \partial^K \vf(\vx_0), \tC
  \right>
  =
  \sum_{d_1=1}^{D_1} \dots \sum_{d_P=1}^{D_P}\left<
  \partial^{K} f(\vx_0),
  \vv_{d_1}^{\otimes p_1}
  \otimes \ldots \otimes
  \vv_{d_P}^{\otimes p_P}
  \right>
  \,
  \in \sR^C\,,
\end{align}
where the $p_i$s sum to $K$ and the $D_i$s are at most $D$ (in the worst case $(D_i, p_i) = (D, 1)\, \forall i$).
For the biharmonic \cref{eq:biharm}, we identify $K = 4, P = 2, \vp = (2, 2), D_1 = D_2 = D, \vv_{d_1} = \ve_{d_1}$, and $\vv_{d_2} = \ve_{d_2}$.
From the Fa\'a di Bruno formula, we know that we can only compute terms of the form $\langle \partial^{K} \vf(\vx_0), \vv^{\otimes K}\rangle$ with a $K$-jet.
The challenge in \cref{eq:sums-k-directional} is that it includes terms whose directions do \emph{not} coincide in all directions (\eg for the biharmonic we have $P=2$ different directions).

Fortunately, \citet{griewank_evaluating_1999} derived an approach to reconstruct linear combinations of mixed-partial derivatives of degree $K$ from a family of $K$-jets, which corresponds exactly to our situation and is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ttc_general}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \left<
    \partial^{K} f(\vx_0),
    \vv_{d_1}^{\otimes p_1}
    \otimes \ldots \otimes
    \vv_{d_P}^{\otimes p_P}
  \right>
  = \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
  \gamma_{\vp \vq}
  \frac{1}{K!}
  \left<
    \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
    \left(\sum_{p=1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p\right)^{\otimes K}
  \right>
\end{equation}
\todo{Felix@Tim: I find the notation confusing: Do we first sum, then take the tensor product? If not, we need to set parentheses.
  Tim: this is excalty what we are doing. First sum, then product. We might use $(...)^{\otimes K}$}
in our notation.
\Cref{sec:appendix_ttc} provides supplementary details for the multi-index notation and the coefficients in the formula.
From this reconstruction we conclude that \cref{eq:sums-k-directional} can be rewritten as
\begin{align} \label{eq:ttc_general_operator}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \sum_{d_1=1}^{D_1} \dots \sum_{d_P=1}^{D_P}
  \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
  \gamma_{\vp \vq}
  \frac{1}{K!}
  \left<
  \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
  \otimes_{k=1}^K
  \sum_{p = 1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p
  \right>.
\end{align}
The authors of \cite{griewank_evaluating_1999} recognized that the coefficients $\gamma_{\vp\vq}/K!$ only depend on the problem structure, i.e., on $K$, $P$ and $\vp$ and not on the function $\vf$ and the directions $\vv_{n_k}$.
Therefore, we can pull out the inner sum as well as the coefficients to obtain the expression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ttc-general}
  \textstyle % Comment out this line if we have enough space
  \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
  \gamma_{\vp \vq}
  \frac{1}{K!}
  \sum_{d_1=1}^{D_1} \dots \sum_{d_P=1}^{D_P}
  \left<
    \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^K
    \sum_{p = 1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p
  \right>.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we can exploit symmetries in $\gamma_{\vp\vq}$ that are often inherent to the differential operators under consideration as illustrated in an example below.


To summarize, we have been able to express a general differential operator given by \cref{eq:sums-k-directional} with arbitrary mixed-partial derivatives through a family of $K$-jets.
Thus, it can be efficiently computed via the collapsed Taylor-mode AD propagating different $K$-jets with directions $\sum_{p} \vv_{n_p}q_p$ instead of depending on expensive nested derivative calls.
It is important to emphasize that, in contrast to nesting derivative calls and other approaches (see \cref{sec:appendix_ttc_other_methods} for a brief overview), our method allows for distributing the computations between parallel tasks, since all jets are independent of each other.


\paragraph{Biharmonic Operator} A prominent differential operator with mixed partial derivatives is represented by the Biharmonic Operator.
Our approach first applies \cref{eq:ttc_general} to the Biharmonic Operator \cref{eq:biharm} with the parameters selected as stated above.
The result is shown in \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm} in the appendix and the coefficients are stated in Figure~\ref{fig:ttc_biharm_coeffs}.


As mentioned before, the coefficients $\gamma_{\vp \vq}$ capture the symmetric structure of the differential operator.
A close look into the definition \cref{eq:ttc_coeff} shows the equality of the coefficients for $\vq = (4,0)$ with $\vq = (0, 4)$ and $\vq = (3, 1)$ with $\vq = (1, 3)$.
Exploiting those symmetries, the formula boils down to \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm_2}.
Furthermore, the second and third sums contain the jets of the first sum.
This is exploited in \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm3}. The last term can be further simplified by leveraging the symmetry of the direction $2 \ve_i + 2 \ve_j$.
This simplification leads to the final efficient jet-based formula as stated in \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm_final} for the Biharmonic Operator that we use for our numerical results. The final equation is\linebreak
\begin{wrapfigure}[20]{r}{0.4\textwidth}
  \centering
  \vspace{-2ex}
  \input{figures/ttc_bilaplacian}
  \vspace{-2ex}
  \caption{\textbf{Illustration of \Cref{eq:ttc-general} for the Bi-Laplacian}, \ie, the jet directions and coefficients for computing the partial derivative $\nicefrac{\partial^4}{\partial^2 x_i \partial^2 x_j}$.

  \label{fig:ttc_biharm_coeffs}
\end{wrapfigure}
based on $D + D(D-1) + \frac{D(D-1)}{2}$ different $4$-jets, where once more we collapse the highest coefficients.
Hence, our formula for the Biharmonic Operator propagates $1 + 3D + 1 + 1 + 3 D(D-1) + 1 + 1 + 3 \frac{D(D-1)}{2} + 1 = 9\frac{D^2}{2} - 3\frac{D}{2} + 6$ vectors through every node in the computational graph, when applying the proposed collapsed Taylor mode.
As before, all jets can be computed in parallel, which provides further benefits for the runtime complexity.

The above procedure describes a generic approach for computing linear differential operators with our collapsed Taylor mode.
% that can be combined with our proposed collapsing method.
% We demonstrated it on the Biharmonic Operator, as it is a commonly used operator of degree greater than two.
We also considered other proposed approaches, which underperform our contribution.
For a comparison, see \cref{sec:appendix_ttc_other_methods}.
Because of its special structure, there is another efficient scheme for computing the Biharmonic Operator that nests twice the Laplacian.
In the appendix, we briefly discuss this approach in combination with our collapsed Taylor mode.
However, our focus here was to show that our idea applies to other differential operators, therefore making it a relevant contribution.
