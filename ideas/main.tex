\section{Brain Dump}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computing fractional derivatives with AD: are there applications?}
    This idea is a bit crazy. But assume we want to compute $\nicefrac{\partial^3}{\partial x^2 \partial y}$. We could do this by nesting $\nicefrac{\partial^{3/2}}{\partial x \partial y^{1/2}}$.
    Is there any literature on automatic fractional differentiation?
\end{itemize}
