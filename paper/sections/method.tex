In this section, we exploit the linearity in the $K$th coefficients when propagating a family of $K$-jets through a computational graph. Such families of $K$-jets were already considered for the Forward-Laplace \cite{li2023forward}, Randomized Taylor-Mode ~\cite{shi2024stochastic, hu2023hutchinson} and the generalized trace operator\todo{T: Cite the papers that also considered this, and maybe an application?}. Afterwards, we show that differential operators with a suitable structure can be computed via the propagation of a appropriately chosen family of jets using an algorithm of Griewank et al. \cite{griewank_evaluating_1999}. The result will also include the approach of \cite{shi2024stochastic} for computing arbitrary differential operators. However, our approach only needs jets of the highest derivative degree occurring in the differential operator. In addition, it has to be emphasized that our proposed method can be completely automated, meaning that it can be implemented as part of a JIT-toolchain. \todo{T: BTW the automation is currently just a claim of me. I did not fully think through the idea of automating the TTC formula. }


\subsection{Exploiting Linearity in Taylor-mode AD}
To derive the proposed method, the considerations start with a sum over $K$th-order directional derivatives of a function $\vf$ like the Laplacian. In our notation, this sum can be represented as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:sum-k-directional}
  \sum_{n=1}^N\left< 
  \partial^{K} f(\vx_0),
  \otimes_{k=1}^K \vv_n
  \right>.
\end{align}
For the Laplacian, one has  $K = 2$, $N$ equals the dimension of $\vx$, i.e., $N= D$, and the vectors are chosen as the unit vectors $\vv_n = \ve_n$.
Instead of nesting derivative calculations to compute the full $K$-th order derivative tensor, $K$-jets can be utilized to efficiently calculate those derivatives. To this end, one
could propagate a family of $K$-jets through the whole computational graph using the Taylor-mode AD as illustrated in the appendix for a simple example in \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-naive}.
Note, that it is crucial to select appropriate input coefficients $\vx_i$. To compute \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, one has to use as $n$-th $K$-jet $\vx_{0, n} = \vv_n$ and $\vx_{k, n} = \vzero\in\R^D$ as input for the Taylor-mode of AD. 

Without further optimizations, the standard Taylor-mode AD propagates $1 + KN$ vectors through every node of the computational graph, where the length of the vectors depend on the individual node.  Subsequently, one has to sum up the corresponding highest derivatives to obtain \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}. This is illustrated in the appendix, see \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-naive}, for our simple example

The approach we propose here is based on the observation that there is a special element in the set of integer partitions $\partitioning(K)$, namely the trivial partition $\tilde{\sigma}= \{K\}$ corresponding to the term
\begin{equation}
    \nu(\tilde{\sigma}) \left<
    \partial \vg(\vh_0),
    \vh_{K, n}
    \right>, 
\end{equation}
of the Faà di Bruno formula. Using the definitions of \cite{hardy2006combinatorics}, one obtains $\nu(\tilde{\sigma}) = 1$
yielding
\begin{equation}\label{eq:faa-di-bruno-expanded}
     \vf_{K, n} 
     = 
     \vg_{K,n} 
     = 
     \displaystyle\sum_{
      \sigma \in \partitioning(K) \setminus \{\tilde{\sigma}\}
     } 
     \nu(\sigma) \left<
     \partial^{|\sigma|} \vg(\vh_0),
     \tensorprod{s \in \sigma} \vh_{K, n}
     \right>
     +
     \left<
     \partial \vg(\vh_0),
     \vh_{K, n}
     \right>
\end{equation}
for our simple example.
The last inner-product term on the right-hand side is linear in $\vh_{K,n}$, marking the key property for our method. To compute the sum of $\{\vg_{K, n}\}_n$ and thus \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, it is possible to directly propagate their sum, like $\sum_n \vh_{K,n}$, due to the linearity of $\left<\partial \vh, \bullet \right>$ and $\left< \partial \vg, \bullet \right>$ instead of passing the highest coefficients, like $\{\vh_{K,n}\}_n$, separately along the nodes of the computational graph. This observation also holds for more general functions $ \vf$. Combining this insight with the Taylor-mode of AD  yields our proposed {\em collapsed Taylor-mode of AD}. This scheme propagates only $1 + (K - 1)N + 1$ vectors at every node in the computational graph, where the length of the vectors varies according to the properties of each individual node in the same way as for the standard Taylor-mode of AD. For our simple example, the collapsed Taylor-mode of AD is detailed in the appendix, see \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-efficient},  where the changes are highlighted in \textcolor{\colorcTM}{\colorcTMname}.
To emphasize that the saving of $N-1$ coefficients at every node in the computational graph is indeed significant for common applications, important operators are discussed below. 

\subsection{Second-order Operators and Traces}
A highlight of our general approach, i.e., the collapsed Taylor-mode of AD for \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}, is that it naturally includes common important differential operators or their approximation.

\paragraph{Laplace Operator} The Laplace operator plays a central role in many physical and engineering applications, including electrostatics, fluid dynamics, and heat conduction. In the context of variational Monte Carlo simulations in quantum mechanics \cite{foulkes2001quantum, pfau2020ab}, the Laplacian of the wave function must be evaluated repeatedly as part of the wave function optimization process. For a function $f: \sR^D \to \sR$, the Laplacian is given as
\begin{align}\label{eq:laplacian}
  \Delta f(\vx_0)
  :=
  \sum_{d=1}^D \frac{\partial^2 f(\vx_0)}{\partial x_d^2}
  =
  \sum_{d=1}^D \left< 
  \partial^2 f(\vx_0),
  \ve_d \otimes \ve_d
  \right>.
\end{align}
If $f$ can be decomposed into $g \circ \vh$, where $\vh$ is vector-valued, as is the case if $\vh$ is a hidden layer of a neural network, then selecting $K = 2$, $N=D$ and $\vv_n = \ve_n$ lifts \cref{eq:laplacian} into the setting of \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}.
For the standard Taylor-mode of AD, one has to propagate $1 + 2D$ vectors through the computational graph, see \cref{eq:laplacian-naive}. If we apply the collapsed Taylor-mode as proposed here, $1 + D + 1$ vectors are propagated. The corresponding propagation of $K$-jets for this example is detailed in \cref{eq:laplacian-efficient}, where changes are highlighted once more in \textcolor{\colorcTM}{\colorcTMname}. Note that this scheme agrees with the one presented in \cite{li2023forward}, but here it is embedded into a general framework.



\paragraph{Weighted sums of second-order derivatives.} %\todo{We can make the connection \cite{hu2023hutchinson} equation (5) clear and discuss the case of $\mC$ being a function of the input} 

A natural generalization of the Laplace operator involves forming weighted sums of second derivatives. Given a positive semi-definite matrix $\boldsymbol{C}\in\mathbb R^{D\times D}$,  we consider the operator
\begin{align}\label{eq:weighted-laplacian}
  \sum_{i,j=1}^D \boldsymbol{C}_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2 \vf(\vx_0)}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}.
\end{align}
This expression represents, for example, the diffusion term in a Kolmogorov-type partial differential equation \cite{hu2023hutchinson}. It is often equivalently written as $\Tr ( \msigma \msigma^\top \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0))$, where $\msigma$ may be a function $\msigma:\mathbb R^{D}\to \mathbb R^{D\times D}$. Since $\boldsymbol{C}$ is positive semi-definite it can be expressed as $\mC = \sum_{n=1}^{\rank(\mC)} \vc_n \vc_n^\top$ for suitable $\vc_n \in \sR^D$. This matches the setting of \cref{eq:sum-k-directional} with $K = 2, N = \rank(\mC)$ and $\vv_n = \vc_n$.  This requires the propagation of $1 + \rank(\mC) + 1$ vectors instead of $1 + 2\rank(\mC)$.
An important special case of \cref{eq:weighted-laplacian} is the Hutchinson Trace Estimation for the Laplacian \cite{hu2023hutchinson}, which is also computable like the Forward-Laplacian scheme \cite{li2023forward}, leveraging the collapsed Taylor-mode. For our simple example $\vf = \vg \circ \vh$ from above, the differential operator \eqref{eq:weighted-laplacian} can be calculated using \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-efficient}.

%Another important differential operator is represented by a symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix $\boldsymbol{C} \in \left(\mathbb{R}^D\right)^{\otimes 2}$:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:weighted-laplacian}
%  \sum_{i,j} \boldsymbol{C}_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2 \vf(\vx_0)}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}.
%\end{align}
%Those operators occur, for example, as 
%\begin{equation*}
%    \Tr (\msigma \msigma^\top \partial^2 \vf(\vx_0)
%\end{equation*}
%in Fokker-Planck and Hamiltonian-Jacobi Bellmann equations. \todo{need citations} Since $\boldsymbol{C}$ is PSD it can be expressed as $\mC = \sum_{n=1}^{\rank(\mC)} \vc_n \vc_n^\top$ for suitable $\vc_n \in \sR^D$. Therefore, it fits the setting of \cref{eq:sum-k-directional} with $K = 2, N = \rank(\mC)$ and $\vv_n = \vc_n$, and can be compute using \cref{eq:sum-taylor-mode-efficient}. This requires the propagation of $1 + \rank(\mC) + 1$ vectors instead of $1 + 2\rank(\mC)$.


\paragraph{Traces of higher-order derivative tensors}
The higher-order Laplacian, e.g., considered as theoretical example in \cite{shi2024stochastic}, or as application in ...\todo{add references}  is also naturally expressible in our framework as
\begin{align}\label{eq:trace-differential-operator}
    \Tr( \partial^K f(\vx) )
    \coloneqq
    \sum_{d=1}^D
    \frac{\partial^K f(\vx_0)}{\partial \evx_d^K}
    =
    \sum_{d=1}^D
    \left< 
    \partial^K f(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{i=1}^K \ve_d
    \right>,
\end{align}
with $N = D$ and $\vv_n = \ve_n$. 

\subsection{Collapsed Taylor-mode AD for arbitrary mixed-derivatives}
Despite being already general enough to unify various approaches for the computation of important differential operators, up to now our framework cannot handle operators that include arbitrary mixed-partial derivatives, i.e. operators where we have to sum over different directions in every inner-product. For orders higher than two, such operators can not be decomposed into the weighted sums scheme, described in \cref{eq:weighted-laplacian}.
To tackle this problem, we extend our framework to transform a differential operator containing those mixed-partial derivatives into a combination of jets using the result of Griewank et al. \cite{griewank_evaluating_1999}.

As one important example, we consider the Biharmonic Operator given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:biharm}
    \Delta^2 \vf(\vx_0)
    \coloneqq
    \sum_{n_1=1}^D \sum_{n_2=1}^D
    \frac{\partial^4 \vf(\vx_0)}{\partial \evx_{n_1}^2 \partial \evx_{n_2}^2}
    =
    \sum_{n_1=1}^D \sum_{n_2=1}^D
    \left<
    \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0),
    \left(\ve_{n_1}\right)^{\otimes 2} \otimes \left(\ve_{n_2}\right)^{\otimes 2}
    \right>.
\end{align}
Once more, we introduce a notation that allows us to cover also more general cases. For the maximal derivative degree $K$, $P \leq K$ different sums and arbitrary directions $\vv_{n_k}$, we can rewrite \cref{eq:biharm} as
\begin{align}\label{eq:sums-k-directional}
  \sum_{n_1=1}^{N_1} \dots \sum_{n_P=1}^{N_P}\left< 
  \partial^{K} f(\vx_0),
  \left(\vv_{n_1}\right)^{\otimes p_1} 
  \otimes \ldots \otimes 
  \left(\vv_{n_P}\right)^{\otimes p_P}
  \right>,
\end{align}
with $K = 4, P = 2, N_1 = N_2 = D, \vp = (2, 2), \vv_{n_1} = \ve_{n_1}$ and $\vv_{n_2} = \ve_{n_2}$. 
Note that for $\vp = (p_1, \dots, p_P)$ one must have $\sum_i p_i = K$. 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sums-k-directional} may include summands where not all directions coincide as it is the case for \cref{eq:sum-k-directional}. Those summands are not directly representable by $K$-jets and thus, not computable via collapsed Taylor-mode AD. However, Griewank et al. derived in \cite{griewank_evaluating_1999} an approach to reconstruct linear combinations of mixed-partial derivatives of degree $K$ from a family of $K$-jets, which corresponds exactly to our situation and is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ttc_general}
    \left< 
  \partial^{K} f(\vx_0),
  \left(\vv_{n_1}\right)^{\otimes p_1} 
  \otimes \ldots \otimes 
  \left(\vv_{n_P}\right)^{\otimes p_P}
  \right> 
  = \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
    \gamma_{\vp \vq}
    \frac{1}{K!}
    \left<
    \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^K
    \sum_{p=1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p
    \right>
\end{equation}
in our notation. Appendix \cref{sec:appendix_ttc} provides supplementary details for the multi-index notation and the coefficients in the formula. From this reconstruction we conclude that \cref{eq:sums-k-directional} can be rewritten as
\begin{align} \label{eq:ttc_general_operator}
  \sum_{n_1=1}^{N_1} \dots \sum_{n_P=1}^{N_P} 
  \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
    \gamma_{\vp \vq}
    \frac{1}{K!}
    \left<
    \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^K
    \sum_{p = 1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p
    \right>.
\end{align}
The authors of \cite{griewank_evaluating_1999} recognized that the coefficients  $\gamma_{\vp\vq}/K!$ only depend on the problem structure, i.e., on $K$, $P$ and $\vp$ and not on the function $\vf$ and the directions $\vv_{n_k}$. Therefore, we can pull out the inner sum as well as the coefficients to obtain the expression
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{\underset{\vq \in \mathbb{N}^P}{|\vq| = K}}
    \gamma_{\vp \vq}
    \frac{1}{K!}
    \sum_{n_1=1}^{N_1} \dots \sum_{n_P=1}^{N_P} 
    \left<
    \partial^{K}\vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^K
    \sum_{p = 1}^P \vv_{n_p} q_p
    \right>.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we can exploit symmetries in $\gamma_{\vp\vq}$ that are often inherent to the differential operators under consideration as illustrated in an example below.

To summarize, we have been able to express a general differential operator given by  \cref{eq:sums-k-directional} with arbitrary mixed-partial derivatives through a family of $K$-jets. Thus, it can be efficiently computed via the proposed collapsed Taylor-mode AD  propagating different $K$-jets with directions $\sum_{p} \vv_{n_p}q_p$ instead of depending on expensive nested derivative calls. It is important to emphasize that, in contrast to nesting derivative calls and other approaches (see \cref{sec:appendix_ttc_other_methods} for a brief overview), our method allows for distributing the work of computing the derivative between parallel tasks, since all jets are independent of each other. 




%\subsection{Examples} \label{sec:example2}

\paragraph{Biharmonic Operator} A prominent differential operator with mixed partial derivatives is represented by the Biharmonic Operator. 
Our approach first applies \cref{eq:ttc_general} to the Biharmonic Operator \cref{eq:biharm} with the parameters selected as stated above. The result is shown in \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm} in  the appendix and the coefficients are listed in \cref{tab:ttc_biharm_coeffs}.

\input{figures/ttc_bilaplacian}

As mentioned before, the coefficients $\gamma_{\vp \vq}$ capture the symmetric structure of the differential operator. A close look into the definition \cref{eq:ttc_coeff} reveals the values of the coefficients for $\vp = (4,0)$ with $\vq = (0, 4)$ and $\vp = (3, 1)$ with $\vp = (1, 3)$. \todo{AW: Tim, please check $\vp$ and $\vq$ here, there were $\vq$ at all four places I guessed this combination} Exploiting those symmetries, the formula boils down to \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm_2}. Furthermore, the second and third sums contain the jets of the first sum. This is exploited in \cref{eq:ttc_for_biharm3}.
The last term can be further simplified by leveraging the symmetry of the direction $2 \ve_i + 2 \ve_j$ leading to the final efficient jet-based formula for the Biharmonic Operator given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ttc_for_biharm_final}
    \begin{aligned}
    \Delta^2 \vf(\vx_0) &= 
    \frac{1}{24} 
    \Big(
    \left(
    2D\gamma_{(2, 2)(4, 0)} + 2 \gamma_{(2, 2)(3, 1)} + \gamma_{(2, 2)(2, 2)}
    \right)
    \sum_{n_1=1}^D 
    \left<
    \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^4 4 \ve_{n_1}
    \right>
    \\
    &+
    2 \gamma_{(2, 2)(3, 1)}
     \sum_{n_1=1}^D\sum_{\underset{n_2 \neq n_1}{n_2=1}}^D\!\!\!
    \left<
    \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^4 \left( 
    3 \ve_{n_1}+\ve_{n_2}
    \right)
    \right>
    \\
    & +
    2 \gamma_{(2, 2)(2, 2)}
    \sum_{n_1=1}^{D - 1} \sum_{n_2 = n_1 + 1}^D 
    \left<
    \partial^4 \vf(\vx_0),
    \otimes_{k=1}^4 \left( 2 \ve_{n_1}+2\ve_{n_2}\right)
    \right>
    \Big).
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The final equation is based on $D + D(D-1) + \frac{D(D-1)}{2}$ different $4$-jets, where once more we can collapse the highest coefficients. Hence, our formula for the Biharmonic Operator propagates $1 + 3D + 1 + 1 + 3  D(D-1) + 1 + 1 + 3 \frac{D(D-1)}{2} + 1 = 9\frac{D^2}{2} - 3\frac{D}{2} + 6$ vectors through every node in the computational graph, when computed the proposed collapsed Taylor-mode AD. As before, all jets can be computed in parallel, which provides further benefits for the run-time complexity. 

The above procedure describes a generic approach for computing linear differential operators with Taylor-Mode AD that can be combined with our proposed collapsing method. 
%We demonstrated it on the Biharmonic Operator, as it is a commonly used operator of degree greater than two. 
We also considered other approach, which underperform our contribution. For a comparison see \cref{sec:appendix_ttc_other_methods}. It has to be remarked that, because of its special structure, there is another efficient scheme for computing the Biharmonic Operator that nests twice the Laplacian. In the appendix, we briefly discuss this approach in combination with our collapsed Taylor-mode AD. However, our focus here was to show that our idea applies to other differential operators, therefore making it a relevant contribution.
